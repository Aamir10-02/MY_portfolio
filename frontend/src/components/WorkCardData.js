We employed NLP techniques such as Tokenization, Bag of Words, and Stemming. A feed-forward neural network was built to train and process the information in the chatbot. Python and Flask were used to develop the AI bot. This project significantly improved the efficiency of information retrieval and demonstrated the potential of AI in real-world applications. Continuous feedback and iterations were made to optimize the model and enhance its accuracy and performance.",
